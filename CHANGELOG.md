# v0.0.1 #

## Blocks ##
- New: Egg Lantern Block
- New: Hedge
- New: Flower Hedges

## Items ##
- New: Cooked Egg
- New: Cracked Egg Shell

## Behavior ##

### Blocks ###
- **Egg Lantern Block**: Can be crafted from 6 Cracked Egg Shells on the top and bottom row, 2 slime balls on the center left and right and one torch in the center. The block will emit a light of level 6 and can be colored by right-clicking with dyes.
- **Hedge**: Can be crafted from 6 leaves of any kind in a crafting table, just like you craft walls. They behave the same way as walls, but are a bit thicker overall. They inherit the same properties as leaves do. Shears and silk touch will drop the block on breaking, hoes will increase mining speed. Fortune on a hoe will increase stick drops from bushes, same as leaves do.
- **Flower Hedges**: Can be created by using a flower on a Hedge block. The flower will be placed on the Hedge and will not be removed when the Hedge is broken. The flower can be any type of flower, including tall flowers. They will grow onto regular hedge blocks that don't have flowers just like grass does to dirt blocks.


### Items ###
- **Cooked Egg**: Eggs can now be cooked in a furnace to make Cooked Eggs. They can be consumed faster and will only restore 1 hunger point.
- **Cracked Egg Shell**: When an egg is thrown, it has a 50% chance to break and drop a Cracked Egg Shell item and now plays an egg-breaking sound. You can also put them over a campfire, but due to excessive heat, the egg will burst and only leave a Cracked Egg Shell.
